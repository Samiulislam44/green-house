        <p class="green">The greenhouse effect is a natural process that warms the Earth's surface and lower atmosphere by trapping heat from the sun. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb infrared radiation from the sun and re-emit it in all directions, keeping the Earth at a suitable temperature for life. Without the greenhouse effect, the Earth's average temperature would be about -20°C, but it currently averages 15°C (59°F).</p>
